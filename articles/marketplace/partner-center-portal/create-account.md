# Create a Commercial Marketplace account in Partner Center

To publish your offers to [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/) or [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), you'll need to create an account in the Commercial Marketplace program in Partner Center. In this article, we'll cover how to create a Partner Center account and how to add new publishers to the Commercial Marketplace program.

>[!Important]
>If you have an account in the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com) that has been moved to Partner Center, you do not need to create a new account. See [Publishers moving from CPP](#publishers-moving-from-cpp) for more information.

## Before you begin

To create an account on Partner Center, make sure you have:

- Authority to sign legal agreements on your company's behalf.
- Your company’s legal business name, address, and primary contact (this can be you).

We’ll verify this information during the account creation process.

There are two ways to create an account:

- If you're new to Partner Center and don't have a Microsoft Network Account, create your account using [Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page](#create-an-account-using-the-partner-center-enrollment-page).
- If you're already enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network, create an account directly from Partner Center using [Create an account using your Microsoft Partner Network enrollment](#create-an-account-using-your-microsoft-partner-network-enrollment).

## Create an account using the Partner Center enrollment page

Use this method if you're new to Partner Center and are not enrolled in the Microsoft Partner Network. This section covers how to create a new Partner Center account, including how to:

- [Register on the Partner Center enrollment page](#register-on-the-partner-center-enrollment-page)
- [Sign in with a work account](#sign-in-with-a-work-account)
- [Agree to the terms and conditions](#agree-to-terms-and-conditions)
- [Provide your publisher profile](#provide-your-publisher-profile)

You'll need to agree to terms and conditions in the [Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=699560).

Your publisher profile includes your company name and MPN ID. If you have not yet done so, you will need to join the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/commercial). After you join the Microsoft Partner Network, you'll be provided with an MPN ID.

Create a Publisher ID. Your Publisher ID uniquely identifies your company and your offers in Marketplace and AppSource.

After you've confirmed your publisher profile information, agree to the terms and conditions and create your Partner Center account by selecting **Accept and continue**.

## Publishers moving from CPP

If your account has been migrated from the [Cloud Partner Portal (CPP)](https://cloudpartner.azure.com), you do not need to create a new Partner Center account. You should have received a customized link to your new Partner Center account in email, and in a banner notification after logging in to your existing CPP account.

Once you've enabled your new Partner Center account by visiting this customized link, you can return to your account by visiting the [Commercial Marketplace dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview) in Partner Center.

The publishing agreement and company profile information will be migrated to your new Partner Center account, along with any previously set up account payout profile information, user accounts and permissions, and active offers associated with your CPP account.

After your account information is moved from CPP to Partner Center, you'll no longer use CPP to make account updates, or manage users, permissions, and billing. For a limited time, any account updates you make in Partner Center will automatically be updated in your read-only CPP account until the CPP portal is eventually deprecated.

## Add new publishers to the Commercial Marketplace program

An organization can have multiple publishers associated with a Commercial Marketplace account. An existing user can add more Publishers after logging into Partner Center by selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers** > **Add Publisher**.

>[!Note]
>Before adding a new publisher, review your existing publishers by logging into Partner Center and selecting **Account Settings** > **Publishers** to see a list of existing publishers.

Another user from the same Azure Active Directory tenant can add a new publisher by following the steps below:

1. Kick off the sign-up flow at [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv).
2. Select **Sign in with a work account** and enter your work email address.
3. Select the **Add Publisher** button.
4. Choose the MPN ID that you want to associate to the publisher.
5. Update the **publisher details** on the form.

   1. **Publisher Name**: The name that will get displayed in Azure Marketplace or AppSource with the offer.
   1. **PublisherID**: An identifier used by Partner Center to uniquely identify your publisher. The default for this field maps to an existing and unique `PublisherID` in the system, which cannot be reused, and therefore this field needs to be updated.
   1. **Contact information**: Update the contact information when necessary.

After you complete the process, you can manage your newly created publisher by going to the **Commercial Marketplace** program listed in the left navigation menu. If you don't see the **Commercial Marketplace** program, refresh the page. The new publisher will appear in the **Publishers** list.
