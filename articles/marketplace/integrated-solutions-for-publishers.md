# Publishing Integrated Solutions

An Integrated Solution combines multiple ISV point solution technologies together, along with the deployment and services of a systems integrator (SI), into a single bundled offer that is listed in the marketplace by the SI as a [consulting services offer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/consulting-services).

These solutions are built to address a specific customer need or scenario, which begins with an understanding of the industry challenge or pain points. Two or more best-of-breed technologies are then integrated by an SI to create a unified and repeatable deployment experience for customers, to get them up and running rapidly. The systems integrator also provides a single point of contact for the customer, providing relevant customization and consulting, and supports around the solution. The outcome is an integrated solution, including technology and services.

See this video for an overview of the [Integrated Solutions Program](https://aka.ms/AA5qos4).

## Key benefits to Integrated Solutions in the marketplace

* Customers can find packaged solutions that solve end-to-end business challenges through the marketplace, and experience accelerated time to value with the technology integrated up front. Customers avoid having to engage separately with multiple ISV apps deployed in a fragmented way.
* ISVs have their IP packaged along with other solutions and services that enhance the value of their technology, delivered by expert SIs.
* SIs create pre-defined, pre-integrated solutions with best-of-breed technology to scale, land, and expand in more customer accounts.
* Microsoft can leverage these pre-integrated, industry aligned solutions to more easily co-sell to customers, with pricing and terms sorted in advance. 

## Eligibility criteria

* All participating partners must have an MPN ID
* Participating SI should be co-sell ready
* Participating ISVs should be IP co-sell 
* At least one participating partner must have Gold Competency in one of the following areas:

    * Application Development
    * Application Integration
    * Application Lifecycle Management
    * Cloud Platform
    * Data Analytics
    * Data Center
    * Data Platform
    * DevOps

* Solution must include at least two partner organizations, bringing together IP and services for a complete customer solution and experience
* Partner IP must be built on Azure, Dynamics 365, and/or Power Platform
* The IP of the integrated solution needs to be differentiated from simply the IP of the ISV + basic SI services
* The objective across all partners is to create a repeatable offering that can be listed, and eventually transacted, through Azure Marketplace and/or AppSource

## Nomination process

Partners who want to participate in the program should identify the other partners they want to work with and complete the [Integrated Solutions Nomination](https://aka.ms/AA5qicu) form. The Integrated Solutions program team will then review the nomination and follow up within 10 business days with approval and next steps. 

## Developing your Integrated Solution 

Once the nomination is approved, follow the below steps, leveraging the linked program resources, to develop your integrated solution: 

1. Complete key business and technical discussions in a workshop format to define the solution (scope, target customers, value proposition, pricing, licensing, terms and conditions, support approach, marketing activities, sales process, and activities) and integration approach (integration points, solution architecture, authentication, user interface, monitoring, deployment mechanism, APIs, and unified data repository). 

    The following resources are available to guide partners through this process:

    1. [Business Decision Workshop Discussion Guide](https://aka.ms/AA5qicx)
    1. [Technical Decision Workshop Discussion Guide](https://aka.ms/AA5qid1)
    1. [Quickstart Video – Business and Technical Workshops](https://aka.ms/AA5qos9)

1. Identify a cross-partner project manager to drive Project Plan and Timeline resulting from business and technical workshops.

1. Complete technical integration of the solution.

1. Finalize solution pricing and decide on single price point to surface on Azure Marketplace or AppSource.

1. Complete marketing collateral for the Azure Marketplace or AppSource listing, including:

    1. Combined solution name
    2. Listing description of integrated solution ([Offer listing best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-offer-listing-best-practices))
    1. Customer 1 pager ([template](https://aka.ms/AA5s08a))
    1. Customer presentation ([template](https://aka.ms/AA5s7ql))
    1. Logo for combined solution 

## Publishing your Integrated Solution 

Once the technical integration is complete and the marketing collateral is ready, refer to the publisher guide for [Consulting Services for Azure Marketplace and AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/consulting-services). Using this resource, determine whether to publish in Azure Marketplace or AppSource depending on the audience you want to reach, prepare your publishing artifacts, and complete the publishing process.

Although there are five service types available for Consulting Services offers, an Integrated Solution must be either a proof of concept or a full implementation.

## Going to market with your Integrated Solution 

Once your solution is live in Azure Marketplace or AppSource, you’ll want to drive awareness and demand generation through marketing activities. Review the activities listed in the [Project Plan and Timeline](https://aka.ms/AA5qiuc), including activities that partners can drive within their own teams and with one another. Then, access [Go-to-Market benefits](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/gtm-your-marketplace-benefits#list-trial-and-consulting-benefits) provided to partners who have published in the marketplace. All Integrated Solution offers are eligible for trial-level benefits.

## Next Steps

See [Integrated Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace/integrated-solutions) for information on purchasing an Integrated Solution in the Marketplace.
