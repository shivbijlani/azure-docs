# Set a retention policy for untagged manifests

Azure Container Registry gives you the option to set a *retention policy* for stored image manifests that don't have any associated tags (*untagged manifests*). When a retention policy is enabled, untagged manifests in the registry are automatically deleted after a number of days you set. This feature prevents the registry from filling up with artifacts that aren't needed and helps you save on storage costs. If  the `delete-enabled` attribute of an untagged manifest is set to `false`, the manifest can't be deleted, and the retention policy doesn't apply.

You can use the Azure Cloud Shell or a local installation of the Azure CLI to run the command examples in this article. If you'd like to use it locally, version 2.0.74 or later is required. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in preview, and some [limitations apply](#preview-limitations). Previews are made available to you on the condition that you agree to the [supplemental terms of use][terms-of-use]. Some aspects of this feature may change prior to general availability (GA).

> [!WARNING]
> Set a retention policy with care--deleted image data is UNRECOVERABLE. If you have systems that pull images by manifest digest (as opposed to image name), you should not set a retention policy for untagged manifests. Deleting untagged images will prevent those systems from pulling the images from your registry. Instead of pulling by manifest, consider adopting a *unique tagging* scheme, a [recommended best practice](container-registry-image-tag-version.md).

If you want to delete single image tags or manifests using Azure CLI commands, see [Delete container images in Azure Container Registry](container-registry-delete.md).

## Preview limitations

* Only a **Premium** container registry can be configured with a retention policy. For information about registry service tiers, see [Azure Container Registry SKUs](container-registry-skus.md).
* You can only set a retention policy for untagged manifests.

## Set a retention policy - CLI

The following example shows you how to use the Azure CLI to set a retention policy for untagged manifests in a registry.

### Enable a retention policy

By default, no retention policy is set in a container registry. To set or update a retention policy, run the [az acr config retention update][az-acr-config-retention-update] command in the Azure CLI. You can specify a number of days between 0 and 365 to retain the untagged manifests. If you don't specify a number of days, the command sets a default of 7 days. After the retention period, all untagged manifests in the registry are automatically deleted.

The following example sets a retention policy of 30 days for untagged manifests in the registry *myregistry*:

```azurecli
az acr config retention update --name myregistry --status enabled --days 30 --type UntaggedManifests
```

The following example sets a policy to delete any manifest in the registry as soon as it's untagged. Create this policy by setting a retention period of 0 days:

```azurecli
az acr config retention update --name myregistry --status enabled --days 0 --type UntaggedManifests
```

### Disable a retention policy

To see the retention policy set in a registry, run the [az acr config retention show][az-acr-config-retention-show] command:

```azurecli
az acr config retention show --name myregistry
```

To disable a retention policy in a registry, run the [az acr config retention update][az-acr-config-retention-update] command and set `--status disabled`:

```azurecli
az acr config retention update --name myregistry --status disabled
```

## Set a retention policy - portal

You can also set a registry's retention policy in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). The following example shows you how to use the portal to set a retention policy for untagged manifests in a registry.

### Enable a retention policy

1. Navigate to your Azure container registry. Under **Policies**, select **Retention** (Preview).
1. In **Status**, select **Enabled**.
1. Select a number of days between 0 and 365 to retain the untagged manifests. Select **Save**.

### Disable a retention policy

1. Navigate to your Azure container registry. Under **Policies**, select **Retention** (Preview).
1. In **Status**, select **Disabled**. Select **Save**.
